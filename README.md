# Market_Basket_Analysis
This project conducts Market Basket Analysis to uncover associations between products in customer transactions. Using association rule mining techniques like the Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms, it identifies frequent item sets and patterns in purchasing behavior, enabling more targeted marketing, product placement strategies, and cross-selling opportunities.
